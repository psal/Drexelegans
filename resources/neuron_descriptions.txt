ID	Entity	Description	Function
1	Neuron	An electrically excitable cell that processes and transmits information through electrical and chemical signals.	 
2	Interneuron	An interneuron (also called relay neuron, association neuron, connector neuron or local circuit neuron) is a neuron that forms a connection between other neurons. Interneurons are neither motor nor sensory.	 
3	Sensory	Sensory neurons are neurons responsible for converting various external stimuli that come from the environment into corresponding internal stimuli.	 
4	Motor	In neurology, the term motor neuron (or motoneuron) classically applies to neurons located in the central nervous system (or CNS) that project their axons outside the CNS and directly or indirectly control muscles.	 
5	Interneuron/Motor	 	 
6	Pharyngeal interneuron	Interneuron of the pharyngeal nervous system.	 
7	Sensory/Interneuron/Motor

11	ADAL	Integrative ring interneurons	Unknown. However, topological cluster analyses suggest ADA may be involved in chemosensation (Sohn et al., 2011).
12	ADAR	Integrative ring interneurons	Unknown. However, topological cluster analyses suggest ADA may be involved in chemosensation (Sohn et al., 2011).
13	ADEL	Anterior deirids. The sensillar branch from the dorsal process follows a dorsal and frequently posterior trajectory ending laterally within the lateral alae in the anterior third of the body.	- ADEL/R are dopaminergic nose touch mechanoceptors. They modulate locomotion behavior in response to the presence of food by textural mechanosensation, wherein upon encountering a lawn of bacteria (or Sephadex G-200 beads) worms slow their forward movement. The three classes of ciliated dopaminergic neurons (CEPs, ADEs, and PDEs) function redundantly in this behavior (i.e. sensing the mechanosensory stimuli during crawling through bacteria (or the beads) and communicating with the motor circuit to bring about the locomotory change) (Sawin et al., 2000). Another form of motor plasticity related to food presence is area restricted search (ARS). CEP and PDE neurons work synergistically to mediate this behavior while ADE modulates it (Hills et al., 2004).

17	ADLL	Amphid neurons, dual (AdL) ciliated sensory ending	- ASH, ADL, ASK and ASE sensory neurons are responsible for the detection of certain chemical repellents. ASH plays a major role in this avoidance, whereas ADL, ASK and ASE play minor roles that are only evident when ASH is missing (de Bono and Maricq, 2005; Hiliard et al., 2002; Sambongi et al., 1999; Bargmann et al., 1990). ADL mediate avoidance behavior from heavy metals (Cd++ and Cu++) (Sambongi et al., 1999), odors (e.g. octanol) (Troemel et al., 1995), high osmotic strength and SDS.
18	ADLR	Amphid neurons, dual (AdL) ciliated sensory ending	- ASH, ADL, ASK and ASE sensory neurons are responsible for the detection of certain chemical repellents. ASH plays a major role in this avoidance, whereas ADL, ASK and ASE play minor roles that are only evident when ASH is missing (de Bono and Maricq, 2005; Hiliard et al., 2002; Sambongi et al., 1999; Bargmann et al., 1990). ADL mediate avoidance behavior from heavy metals (Cd++ and Cu++) (Sambongi et al., 1999), odors (e.g. octanol) (Troemel et al., 1995), high osmotic strength and SDS.
19	AFDL	Amphid neurons with finger-like (AfD) ciliated end	- Functions in thermotaxis: AFD neurons are the main thermosensors in C. elegans and laser ablation of the AFD pair makes most animals athermotactic (Ma and Shen, 2012; Beverly et al, 2011; Kuhara et al, 2008; Satterlee et al., 2004; Mori and Ohshima, 1995). After cultivation at a uniform temperature (Tc) with sufficient food, animals preferentially migrate to their cultivation temperature (Tc) when placed on a thermal gradient, and move isothermally at this temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). Animals sense and record their Tc by AFD (major thermosensory), AWC and ASI neurons (Beverly et al, 2011; Kuhara et al., 2008; Biron et al., 2008). This memory is plastic and can be reset upon cultivation at a different temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). The AFD, AWC and ASI neurons may to act in concert to increase turning rate when animals encounter higher temperatures than Tc on a gradient to move down the gradient toward colder temperatures near Tc (negative thermotaxis) (Biron et al., 2008). To track isotherms, animals do not actively pursue isothermal alignment, but once serendipitously aligned along an isotherm (at T=Tc), they track by suppressing turns (Luo et al., 2006).This may be achieved by the animal increasing its reversal frequency when it detects a rise in temperature, which activates Ca++ influx in AFD via cGMP-dependent TAX-2/TAX-4 cation channel (cGMP production in AFD is redundantly carried out by GCY-8, GCY-18 and GCY-23 and gcy-23, gcy-8, and gcy-18 triple mutants show a cryophilic or athermotactic phenotype) (Inada et al., 2006). AFD neurons respond to thermal stimuli above Tc with continuous, graded calcium signals in a deterministic and highly reproducible way. The thermal information is transmitted by AFD and AWC to AIY interneurons for information processing, and AIY neurons, in turn, transmit it to AIZ and RIA interneurons for further processing. It is suggested that activation of AFD neurons by warming above Tc induces the animal to reverse by inhibiting AIY since loss of AFD (by ablation) suppresses spontaneous reversals in an AIY-dependent manner, while loss of AIY (by ablation) increases spontaneous reversals (de Bono and Maricq 2005; Tsalik and Hobert, 2003).

25	AIML	Ring interneurons bridging between sensory inputs	Serotonin secreted by both synaptic vesicles and dense core vesicles seem to diffuse readily to the extrasynaptic space adjacent to the AIM and RIH neurons. Among 5 classes (NSM, ADF, HSN, AIM, RIH) of serotonergic neurons, RIH and AIM mainly take up serotonin from outside -produced by the remaining serotonergic neurons- via the membrane serotonin transporter (MOD-5/SERT), rather than synthesizing it themselves (Jafari et al., 2011).

They have a key role in behavioral plasticity in paradigms in which starvation is paired with a thermal or chemical cue (de Bono and Maricq, 2005; Ishihara et al., 2002).

Additionally, it synapses directly onto SMB head motor neurons .
33	ALA	Has two processes that branch from the anterior po	- Involved in inducing normal lethargus quiescence (i.e., cessation of pharyngeal pumping and locomotion during the lethargus periods (an EGF/LET-23-induced sleep-like state prior to molts). ALA neuron inhibits locomotion by inhibiting AVE, which normally functions to promote locomotion. Synapse between ALA and AVE is contacted by the CEPsh glia and CEPsh cells inhibit synaptic transmission from ALA to AVE, promoting locomotion.
34	ALML	Anterior lateral microtubule cells, touch receptor	Along with AVM and PLM, sense touch to the body and provide input to the command (inter) neurons (PVC, AVB, AVD, AVA) via both synaptic connections and gap junctions (Chalfie et al., 1985). The touch cells form gap junctions with agonist interneurons and chemical synapses with the antagonist interneurons. Hence, the anterior touch cells ALML/R and AVM form gap junctions with the backward movement interneuron AVD, but they provide synaptic input to the forward interneurons (AVB and PVC) (Kaplan and Driscoll, 1997; Goodman, 2006). See body touch circuit here.

38	AQR	Postembryonically born neuron with rudimentary cil	Along with PQR, URX and AUA, AQR regulate social feeding (or aggregation on a bacterial lawn) and bordering (the accumulation of animals on the thickest part of a bacterial lawn) behavior since suppressing the activity of AQR, PQR and URX neurons inhibits social feeding (Coates and de Bono , 2002). AQR, PQR and URXfunction as sensors of environmental oxygen which is a quantitative regulator of social feeding (Gray et al., 2004). Decreases in oxygen leads to a dose-dependent suppression of social feeding behavior and bordering. Oxygen acts in parallel to NPR-1 in regulating social feeding behavior.

72	AVFL	Interneuron	 
73	AVFR	Interneuron	 
74	AVG	Ventral cord interneuron	Anterior guidepost neuron. AVG pioneers the right tract of the ventral nerve cord. It expresses UNC-6 at 3-fold embryo stage to provide a continuous UNC-6 (netrin)-labeled pathway restricted to the right tract of the nerve cord. The unilateral UNC-6 cue from AVG guides various paired axons growing from the nerve ring and lumbar ganglia to make rightward decussations as they enter the ventral nerve cord. UNC-6 also promotes bundling of axons within the cord itself. If the parent of AVG is ablated in wild-type embryos, interneurons and ventral cord motor neurons form several small fascicles rather than one tight bundle of right side tract and occasionally the right side axons shift to the left side (Wadsworth et al., 1996; Wadsworth and Hedgecock, 1986; Durbin 1987; Antebi et al., 1997).

115	DD1	Ventral cord motor neurons, reciprocal inhibitors,	Sinusoidal body movement. DD's receive input from VA and VB neurons, and hence, are likely to be active during ventral muscle contractions. They form neuromuscular junctions dorsally that coordinately relax the dorsal muscles during ventral muscle contraction (Driscoll and Kaplan, 1997). D-type neurons may also regulate the wave amplitude of the sinusoidal movement since unc-25 and unc-30 mutants that lack functional D neurons generate rhythmic sinusoidal movement with a reduced amplitude (McIntire et al., 1993).

121	DVA	Ring interneurons, cell bodies in dorsorectal gang	Mechanosensory integration. The PVD and DVA neurons are presynaptic to both the forward and backing interneurons, and provide input to both the anterior and posterior touch circuits. Animals lacking these neurons respond to tap stimulus with diminished forward accelerations and reversals. These neurons, therefore, seem to maintain the overall activity of the touch circuit (Wicks et al., 1996; Driscoll and Kaplan, 1997; Goodman, 2007). DVA represents a stretch receptor neuron that regulates sensory-motor integration during C. elegans locomotion. trp-4, a homologue of the mechanosensitive TRPN channel, acts as a stretch-sensitive proprioceptor in DVA. DVA both positively and negatively modulates locomotion, providing a unique mechanism whereby a single neuron can fine-tune motor activity (Li et al., 2006).
122	DVB	An excitatory GABAergic motor neuron/interneuron l	Defecation. AVL and DVB are excitatory GABAergic motor neurons for the enteric muscles (Avery and Thomas, 1997; McIntire et al., 1993). Together with AVL, activates expulsion muscle contraction (E.p or EMC).

Three classes of mechanosensory neurons (ASH, FLP, and OLQ) act in parallel to mediate this response. Each sensory neuron class accounts for a fraction of the normal response, as follows: ASH, 45%; FLP, 29%; and OLQ, 5%. The remaining responses (~10%) are mediated by the ALM and AVM neurons, which sense anterior body touch (Kaplan and Driscoll, 1997; Goodman, 2006).

126	HSNL	Hermaphrodite specific motor neurons. These cells	Innervate the vulval muscles and stimulate egg laying by hermaphrodites. Laser ablation of both HSN neurons results in animals that fail to lay eggs normally and become severely bloated with eggs retained in the uterus (egl phenotype). HSN neurons are the only neurons of the egg-laying circuitry, as defined by the synaptic connectivity, that have been shown to be required for normal egg-laying (Chalfie and White, 1988). Hermaphrodites that lack the HSN motor neurons do lay eggs in response to exogenous serotonin (Trent et al, 1983).
127	HSNR	Hermaphrodite specific motor neurons. These cells	Innervate the vulval muscles and stimulate egg laying by hermaphrodites.

Hermaphrodites that lack the HSN motor neurons do lay eggs in response to exogenous serotonin (Trent et al, 1983).
128	I1L	Pharyngeal interneurons. The anterior projections	The pharyngeal and somatic nervous systems are connected to each other via gap junctions between the extrapharyngeal RIP neurons and the pharyngeal I1 neurons. When this connection is disrupted by ablation of RIPs, pharyngeal pumping becomes unresponsive to light touch which is sensed by somatic touch neurons (Avery and Thomas, 1997). I1s also synapse on MC neurons and modulate the rate of pharyngeal pumping in the absence of bacteria (Avery and Thomas, 1997).
129	I1R	Pharyngeal interneurons. The anterior projections	The pharyngeal and somatic nervous systems are connected to each other via gap junctions between the extrapharyngeal RIP neurons and the pharyngeal I1 neurons. When this connection is disrupted by ablation of RIPs, pharyngeal pumping becomes unresponsive to light touch which is sensed by somatic touch neurons (Avery and Thomas, 1997). I1s also synapse on MC neurons and modulate the rate of pharyngeal pumping in the absence of bacteria (Avery and Thomas, 1997).

Pharyngeal relaxation becomes quicker when I5 is ablated. When both I5 and M3 are ablated there is a delay in relaxation that is indistinguishable from that caused by ablation of M3 alone, suggesting I5 slows down relaxation by inhibiting M3 (Avery and Thomas, 1997)

136	IL1DL	Neurons of inner labial sensilla, ciliated endings	When worms are touched on either the dorsal or ventral sides of their nose with an eyelash, they interrupt the normal pattern of foraging and undergo an aversive head-withdrawal reflex. This simple reflex is mediated by two classes of mechanosensory neurons (OLQ and IL1) and their synaptic targets, the RMD motor neurons. Killing any of these cells, alone or in combination, diminishes the head withdrawal reflex. IL1, OLQ, and RMD also regulate spontaneous foraging movements. Laser operated animals lacking IL1 and OLQ forage abnormally slowly and make exaggerated dorsal and ventral nose turns (Hart et al., 1995; Kaplan and Driscoll, 1997; Goodman, 2006).

However, laser ablation does not lead to any abnormalities of movement or touch sensitivity (Chalfie et al., 1985) and no role in tap-withdrawal reflex has been found (Wicks and Rankin, 1995).

152	M2R	M2L/R are a pair of unipolar neurons with processe	Unknown or redundant (Avery and Thomas, 1997; Chiang et al., 2002).
153	M3L	M3s are a bilaterally symmetric pair of inhibitory	M3s modulate the timing of pharyngeal relaxation in corpus and promote rapid relaxation of the pharyngeal muscle following contraction. When M3s are decoupled from the pharyngeal muscle by mutating the postsynaptic receptor (a glutamate-gated chloride channel partly encoded by avr-15) for M3 neurotransmission, the duration of pharyngeal contraction increases (Dent et al., 1997). Each M3 is suggested to be proprioceptive and fire in response to corpus muscle contraction, which, in turn, induces inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (repolarization) and relaxation of the muscle. This relaxation seems to be important for effective transport of bacteria within the lumen (Avery and Thomas, 1997). Exogenous serotonin mimics the presence of food and induces rapid contraction-relaxation cycles with shortened action potentials in pharynx. This effect is dependent on MC and M3 neurons (see model below) (Niacaris and Avery, 2003).
154	M3R	M3s are a bilaterally symmetric pair of inhibitory	M3s modulate the timing of pharyngeal relaxation in corpus and promote rapid relaxation of the pharyngeal muscle following contraction.

M4 synapses on the isthmus and the terminal bulb, and is necessary for posterior isthmus peristalsis (Avery and Thomas, 1997). Worms lacking M4 continue pumping, however, bacteria become trapped in corpus and anterior isthmus and these worms fail to grow since they can not pass the food to their intestines.

157	MCL	MC's are a pair of cholinergic excitatory (motor)	MC's control the frequency of pharyngeal pumping (Avery and Thomas, 1997). They initiate pharyngeal muscle action potentials, and hence, function as pacemakers of pumping. Release of Ach from MC neurons stimulates the muscle via a postsynaptic nicotinic ACh receptor encoded by eat-2 (Niacaris and Avery, 2003; McKay et al., 2004). In eat-2 mutants MC is decoupled from pharyngeal muscle and the pharynx is unable to pump rapidly in the presence of food. Modulators of pharyngeal pumping such as exogenous serotonin mostly act through MC neurons.

159	MI	MI is a unipolar neuron which is located in the do	Unknown or redundant (Avery and Thomas, 1997).
160	NSML	NSM cell bodies are located in the pharyngeal subv	Initially suggested to have neurohumoral function signaling the presence of food to the body since NSM's appear secretory by morphology and have processes that run in close apposition to the pseudocoelom over most of their lengths (Albertson and Thomson, 1976, Avery and Thomas, 1997). They were postulated to sense bacteria in their lumen by their proprioceptive endings and transmit this to the rest of the body by secretions to the pseudocoelomic fluid. The presence of food leads to increased pharyngeal pumping, decreased locomotion and increased egg-laying behavior. Exogenous application of serotonin also induces these responses supporting the hypothesis NSM's can function neurohumorally by serotonin secretion. However, ablation of NSM's have only subtle effects on pumping suggesting they may not play any important role in this behavior (Avery et al., 1993, Avery and Thomas, 1997). When placed on a bacterial lawn, previously food-deprived animals slow down their locomotion to a higher degree compared to well-fed animals. This phenomenon is described as "the enhanced slowing response". When NSM's are ablated there is a small but significant decrease in the enhanced slowing response suggesting NSM's contribute to this behavior (Sawin et al., 2000).

AQR, PQR and URX function as sensors of environmental oxygen which is a quantitative regulator of social feeding (Gray et al., 2004). Decreases in oxygen leads to a dose-dependent suppression of social feeding behavior and bordering. Oxygen acts in parallel to NPR-1 in regulating social feeding behavior.

187	PVM	Posterior ventral microtubule cell, generated post	PVM is ultrastructurally very similar to the other touch cells, and its differentiation is controlled by the same genetic pathway that controls differentiation of the other five touch receptor neurons. However, PVM does not mediate a locomotory response to gentle touch (Chalfie and Sulston, 1981) and does not appear to have a critical role in touch sensitivity (for discussion see Kaplan and Driscoll, 1997; Goodman, 2006). It is postulated to be a stretch receptor.

194	PVR	Interneuron, projects along ventral cord to ring	 
195	PVT	Interneuron, projects along ventral cord to ring.	Midline neuroblast, secretes UNC-6, serves as a guidepost neuron to guide growing axons from the lumbar ganglia in the posteriormost region of the ventral cord. When PVT is ablated embryonically, these axons follow multiple routes to enter the ventral cord instead of making tight bundles (Antebi et al., 1997; Ren et al., 1999). Postembryonically, PVT functions to keep the ventral cord fascicles intact. Early larval ablation of PVT induces axons of AVKL/R, PVQL/R, HSNL/R and RMEV to aberrantly cross the ventral midline (Aurelio et al., 2002).

However, killing RIA neurons has no effect on chemotaxis (Iino and Yoshida, 2009; Tanizawa et al., 2006; Mori and Ohshima 1995). In the original two-drive (thermophilic vs cryophilic) model of thermotaxis, RIA is suggested to integrate signals processed in the thermotaxis neural circuit and emit outputs to downstream neurons (Mori and Ohshima, 1995; Tanizawa et al, 2006). Multiple transmissions including EAT-4-dependent glutamate from RIA are involved in communicating processed information to downstream neurons, thereby generating ultimate thermotactic outputs (Ohnishi et al, 2011). Although it is not clear as to which neurons downstream of RIA are main component neurons in the circuit, RIA is heavily connected presynaptically to SMD or RMD head motor neurons that regulate turning behavior, suggesting SMD and RMD control turn frequency and run duration depending on the thermal information transmitted by RIA (Ohnishi et al, 2011; Zariwala et al, 2003; White et al, 1986; Gray et al, 2005).

Animals navigate the O2 gradients by O2-induced changes in locomotion speed, reversal and turning behavior (Cheung et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2004). This preference for intermediate O2 levels (Gray et al., 2004), may work to allow oxidative metabolism but avoid oxidative stress (Lee and Atkinson, 1977). The intermediate O2 preference also promotes aggregation behavior, possibly since aggregating C. elegans locally deplete O2 to preferred levels (Gray et al., 2004; Rogers et al., 2006). The rise in O2 levels detected by animals leaving a group induces reversal (backing) and turning. Conversely, the fall in O2 encountered when entering a group suppresses reversal, turning, and rapid locomotion, allowing the animal to stay with the group. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC, e.g. GCY-35 and GCY-36)-expressing oxygen-sensing neurons (URX, AQR, PQR, SDQ, BDU, ALN, and PLN) mediate the avoidance of high O2 levels (Zimmer et al, 2009). URX appears to be the most important member of this group, since its activity is uniquely important for aggregation (Coates and de Bono, 2002), while for aerotactic behavior in an O2 gradient, URX is redundant with other sGC-expressing neurons (Chang et al., 2006). The locations of URX in the head and PQR in the tail facilitate high O2 avoidance by the animal accelerating forward without changing direction of movement when its tail/PQR encounters high O2 and by reversal and turning when its head/URX encounters high O2 (Busch et al., 2012). Two post-synaptic targets of URX, AUA and RMG, seem to be involved in this O2-induced behavioral response.
